### What is RsNano?

RsNano is a full Nano node written in Rust.

### What is Nano?

Nano is a digital payment protocol designed to be accessible and lightweight, 
with a focus on removing inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. 
With ultrafast transactions and zero fees on a secure, green and decentralized 
network, this makes Nano ideal for everyday transactions.

### Installation

## Option 1: Run the official docker image

    docker run -p 7075:7075 -v ~/Nano:/root/Nano simpago/rsnano:V2.0 --network=live node run

## Option 2: Build your own docker image

    docker build -f tools/scripts/docker/node/Dockerfile -t rsnano-node https://github.com/simpago/rsnano-node.git#releases/v2

    docker run -p 7075:7075 -v ~/Nano:/root/Nano rsnano-node:latest --network=live node run

## Option 3: Build from source

Currently you can only build RsNano on Linux and on Mac.

To just build and run the rsnano_node:

    git clone https://github.com/simpago/rsnano-node.git
    git switch releases/v2
    cd rsnano-node/main
    cargo build --release
    cargo run --release -- --network=live node run

To install and run the rsnano_node executable:

    git clone https://github.com/simpago/rsnano-node.git
    git switch releases/v2
    cd rsnano-node
    cargo install --path main
    rsnano_node --network=live node run

## Running it with a GUI

You can even run an RsNano node with a GUI that looks like this:
![RsNano Insight App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsnano-node/rsnano-node/refs/heads/develop/doc/insight_app.png)

Run these commands:

    cd rsnano-node/tools/insight
    cargo run --release

# The codebase

Have a look at the [AI generated documentation of the codebase](https://deepwiki.com/rsnano-node/rsnano-node).

The Rust code is structured according to A-frame architecture and is built with nullable infrastructure. 
This design and testing approach is [extensively documented on James Shore's website](http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks)

Watch James Shore's presentation of nullables on YouTube: [Testing Without Mocks - James Shore | Craft Conference 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjZg6lDBKkk)

The following diagram shows how the crates are organized. The crates will be split up more when the codebase grows.

* `main`: The node executable.
* `daemon`: Starts the node and optionally the RPC server.
* `node`:The node implementation.
* `rpc_server`: Implemenation of the RPC server.
* `websocket_server`: Implemenation of the websocket server.
* `wallet`: Wallet implementation. It manages multiple wallets which can each have multiple accounts.
* `ledger`: Ledger implementation. It is responsible for the consinstency of the data stores.
* `store_lmdb`: LMDB implementation of the data stores.
* `messages`: Message types that nodes use for communication.
* `network`: Manage outbound/inbound TCP channels to/from other nodes.
* `work`: Proof of work generation via CPU or GPU
* `types`: Contains the basic types like `BlockHash`, `Account`, `KeyPair`,...
* `utils`: Contains utilities like stats
* `nullables`: Nullable wrappers for infrastructure libraries.
